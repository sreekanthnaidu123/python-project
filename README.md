# Hello world in python
That's the first program I created while taking the [python for everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) course, and I learned in this program how to print hello world using python, which is the classic program we all write when we want to learn a new language, the course is cool I recommend it, and to see more programs I created from this course check out my other repositories.
